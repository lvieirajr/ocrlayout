# OcrLayout Project

Provides the ability to get more meaninful text out of common OCR outputs. It manipulates the Bounding Boxes of lines or words. 

## Bounding Box Helper 

While OCR processing images containing lots of textual information, it might be relevant to assemble the generated text into meaninful single-line sentences or paragraphs.

### More meanifull output for what? 

With a closer-human-readable text...
- Text Analytics you may leverage any Text Analytics such as Key Phrases, Entities Extraction with more confidence of its outcome
- Accessibility : Any infographic becomes alive, overcoming the alt text feature.
- Modern browser Read Aloud feature : it becomes easier to build solutions to read aloud an image, increasing verbal narrative of visual information. 
- Machine Translation : get more accurate MT output as you can retain context. 
- Sentences/Paragraph Classification : from scanned-base images i.e. contracts, having a more meaninful textual output allows you to classify it at a granular level in terms of risk, personal clause or conditions. 

BBoxHelper has support for Azure/Google Computer Vision API.

Our goal here is not to conduct a comparison between Azure & Google Computer Vision API but to provide a consistent way to output OCR text for further processing
