# Simple infographic

![Screenshot](img/image253.png)

The above image is a simple infographic, containing blocks of Text and countries references well separated. 

## Azure 
The below image represents the raw Azure OCR output where we drew each line of text bounding boxes.

### Azure Raw Text ouput
The below output is not sorted in any just taken as-is from Azure Computer Vision response.

```
We can clearly see that the lines of text are processed in a certain order in Azure Computer Vision adding the noise of the continents in between "sentences".
Sorting on the Y axis ascending will probably give the same result as the raw output. So our goal is to rebuild the logical stream of text. 

### Azure BBoxing
Boxes are drawn on the original image. The numbers in red reprensent the blockid we use to sort the final boxes. See our [sorting](/sorting) section for more details.

#### Azure BBoxing text output
```
SOUTH AMERICA
Fossil remains of Cynognathus, a Triassic land reptile approximately 3 m long.
AFRICA
Fossil remains of the freshwater reptile Mesosaurus
INDIA
ANTARCTICA
Fossil evidence of the Triassic land reptile Lystrosaurus.
AUSTRALIA
Fossils of the fern Glossopteris found in all of the southern continents, show that they were once joined.
```
Here we do have a more concise output, clearly isolating the countries references and explanations of this infographic. We see the influence of an X axis sorting. 

Let's check on the same example with Google OCR engine... 

## Google 
The below image represents the raw Google OCR output where we drew each line of text bounding boxes. Yellow colored are the words, red is for paragraphs and blue are for the blocks. See [Google Ocr](/engines/google) for more details.

## AWS 
The below image represents the raw AWS Textextract output where we drew each line of text bounding boxes. Yellow colored are the words, red is for lines. See [AWS Ocr](/engines/aws) for more details.

## Conclusion

With this simple example we can see all outputs are more aligned hence you can proceed with your next Textual transformation (i.e. Translation etc.)
