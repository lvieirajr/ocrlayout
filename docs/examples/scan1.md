The above image is a simple scanned image from a PDF. 

You will see that some OCR engines will clearly expose their line processing while other would do a better raw output. 

Let's dive in each OCR Engine showing you how BBOXHelper helps increasing the coherence of the textual output.

DNV GL ENERGY TRANSITION OUTLOOK - OIL AND GAS
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The energy transition will be characterized by many sub-transitions
in the next three decades. Based on the DNV GL model of the
world energy system, we forecast that global final energy demand
will flatten at 430 exajoules (EJ) from 2030 onwards (7% higher
than 2015), reflecting accelerating improvement in global energy
efficiency, driven largely by the electrification of the world's energy
system and an increased share of renewables.

Key challenge here is the 2-column section where using the Raw output phrases aren't consistent with the actual visual.

So we need to have the 2-columns text clearly isolated from each other but sequential. You would read column One first then continue to read on column 2.

## Conclusion

In this example we could see that BBoxHelper brought the concept of columns of text to get us better textual output. Besides key difference between the OCR engines, we now have a consistent output.
